## AppImage

This application is an internet radio client. It streams music from the internet, so it needs network access.
If you run this app inside **firejail**, make sure the firejail profile allows network access. Otherwise it won’t be able to stream any audio.
To install the provided firejail profile:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/firejail
cp /path/to/extracted/usr/share/firejail/listenmoe.profile ~/.config/firejail/
firejail listenmoe
```
